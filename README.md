# Radiology Scheduling (Synthetic) + ML Demo
Synthetic radiology scheduling simulator + ML demo for education. Models XR/US/CT/MR demand across ED/inpatient/outpatient, including downtime and outpatient no-shows, and provides an interactive web UI to explore policy tradeoffs. Not for clinical use.
## Educational Use Only (Non-Clinical)
This project uses **synthetic data** for **education and research**.
This software is **NOT a medical device** and **NOT validated** for clinical or operational use.
Do NOT use for patient care, staffing, scanner scheduling, or real hospital operations.
## Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Generate synthetic data (Python)
2. Train models (Python)
3. Export models to the web UI (ONNX)
4. Open the interactive dashboard (GitHub Pages)
